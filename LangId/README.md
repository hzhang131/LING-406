# LING 406 MP2: Language Models Applied to the Task of Language Identification

## Contains:
1. answer.pdf 
2. driver.py -- driver file for all three models.
3. letterLangId.py -- letter-bigram with Add-one smoothing.
4. wordLangId.py -- word-bigram with Add-one smoothing.
5. wordLangId2.py -- word-bigram with *Good-Turing smoothing*
6. LangId.* -- included training and testing files.

## How to Run:
```
python3 driver.py

```

## What will be run:
All three python files will be run and a message of each model's accuracy will be displayed to the console.
Output of each file will be saved to corresponding output files.

## Kindly reminder:
Please allow some time for all three files to finish running. I am *really* lazy and did not think about runtime 
when I was doing this assignment. Sigh. 
If your PC/computer or whatever you are using is alright, the three python files will stop running within 5 minutes.
